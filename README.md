# CP-setup
Automation to make my PC ready for competitive programming

What does the automation does right now : -
1. opens the competitive prgramming website ( codeforces ) in your default webbrowser
2. creates a new file cpp file `../cp/test.cpp` and opens it in your default text editor

## Language used
- 🐍 python

### Setup required 🛠
- Most of the stuff is plain python scripts which will only require you to have **python installed on your device** and an **IDE/text editor** to see and make changes to the scripts on your system.
- If you don't have python on your machine then you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
